# arduino-projects
A repository for holding info on my Arduino projects

Each folder contains a Code folder, which contains the Arduino sketch as well as the libraries needed for it to work.
They also contain an Information folder, which contains other info needed for the product, such as models of the circuit and a parts list, so you can purchase each of the parts to recreate the projects.
